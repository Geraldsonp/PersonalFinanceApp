# Sprint 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure (5 days)

## Task 1: Set up the Blazor WebAssembly project structure (1 day)

### Instructions:
1. Install the latest .NET SDK (preferably .NET 7 or later)
2. Create a new Blazor WebAssembly project using the command:
   ```
   dotnet new blazorwasm -o PersonalFinanceApp
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code)
4. Review the project structure and familiarize yourself with the default files
5. Update the `wwwroot/index.html` file to include appropriate meta tags and title
6. Create folders for components, services, and models in the project structure

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Blazor WebAssembly project is created and runs without errors
- [ ] Project structure includes folders for components, services, and models
- [ ] `index.html` is updated with appropriate meta tags and title
- [ ] Project can be built and run locally, displaying the default Blazor page

## Task 2: Implement basic routing structure and main layout (1 day)

### Instructions:
1. Create a new `Shared/MainLayout.razor` component for the app's main layout
2. Design a responsive layout with a header, navigation menu, and main content area
3. Create placeholder pages for Overview, Transactions, Budgets, Savings, and Bills
4. Set up routing in the `App.razor` file to navigate between these pages
5. Implement a navigation menu in the `MainLayout.razor` component

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] `MainLayout.razor` component is created with a responsive design
- [ ] Placeholder pages are created for all main sections of the app
- [ ] Routing is correctly set up in `App.razor`
- [ ] Navigation menu allows users to move between different pages
- [ ] Layout is responsive and looks good on various screen sizes

## Task 3: Create a data service for local JSON file management (2 days)

### Instructions:
1. Create a `Models` folder and define data models for Transaction, Budget, SavingsPot, and RecurringBill
2. Create a `Services` folder and implement a `DataService` class
3. Add methods in `DataService` to load data from the local JSON file
4. Implement methods to perform CRUD operations on the loaded data (in-memory for now)
5. Create a `data.json` file in the `wwwroot` folder with sample data
6. Use dependency injection to make the `DataService` available throughout the app

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Data models are defined for all required entities
- [ ] `DataService` can load data from the local JSON file
- [ ] CRUD operations are implemented for all data types
- [ ] `data.json` file is created with sample data
- [ ] `DataService` is registered for dependency injection in `Program.cs`

## Task 4: Implement a responsive design system using Tailwind CSS (1 day)

### Instructions:
1. Install Tailwind CSS in the Blazor WebAssembly project
2. Configure Tailwind CSS to work with Blazor (you may need to use a PostCSS build process)
3. Create a custom Tailwind configuration file to define the app's color scheme and other design tokens
4. Apply Tailwind classes to the `MainLayout.razor` component and placeholder pages
5. Create reusable CSS components for common UI elements (buttons, cards, inputs)

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Tailwind CSS is installed and configured in the project
- [ ] Custom Tailwind configuration is created with the app's design tokens
- [ ] `MainLayout.razor` and placeholder pages use Tailwind classes for styling
- [ ] Reusable CSS components are created for common UI elements
- [ ] The app's design is consistent and responsive across different screen sizes
